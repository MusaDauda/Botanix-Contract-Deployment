# Deploy A token Contract on Botanix Testnet (SpiderChain)

### Add chain network on [Chainlist](https://chainlist.org/chain/3636)

### Get Faucet
[Faucet 1](https://botanix.5thweb.io/)

[Faucet 2](https://faucet.botanixlabs.dev/)

[Faucet 3](https://dripdripdrip.xyz/botanix-testnet)

Head over to the Ethereum [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) and make a new Solidity file, for example Botanix-token.sol . Paste the following [code](./Botanix-token.sol) into your new Solidity script


### Replace the following values:

- **Line 62:** symbol = "QKC"; Choose your own symbol

- **Line 63:** name = "QuikNode Coin"; Choose your own name

- **Line 64:** decimals = 2; set the decimal (value in which tokens can be divided, 0 to 8 decimal units can be used) and establish a total supply value as you wish

- **Line 65:** _totalSupply = 100000; Choose a total supply

- **Line 66:** balances[YOUR_METAMASK_WALLET_ADDRESS] = _totalSupply; Please change YOUR_METAMASK_WALLET_ADDRESS to your own wallet address (This one can be found in your MetaMask interface)

- **Line 67:** emit Transfer(address(0), YOUR_METAMASK_WALLET_ADDRESS, _totalSupply);


**Note:** *The total supply value must have additional trailing zeros as specified by the decimals field. For example, if the decimals value of thw contract is 2 and we need a total supply of 1000 tokens, we will have to set the total supply variable to 100000 (simply because it wonâ€™t allow a decimal point).*

#### Compile the smart contract. Make sure you select the right compiler based on the chosen Solidity version.

### Deploy it using injected Web3 (make sure to select Botanix testnet on MetaMask before compiling the contract) and select the right contract to be deployed. Approve the transaction from MetaMask.

**Note:** *We need to deploy the main token contract, select the name of the contract appropriately under the contracts section before deploying the contract (Here: GimmeBorpaToken)*

### Copy Your Token Contract Address

### Import Token Address to Metamask:
Open Metamask, go to the Token tab and click on the Import Tokens button. Paste the contractâ€™s address in the first field. Metamask will fetch the Token Symbol and decimals automatically.

*In case the gas fee is too high, you can try to change it in MetaMask, your transaction should still go through.*

*You can verify your transaction and even download a custom receipt in PDF format. Very cool!* ðŸ˜Ž

# Congratulations, you have now provided liquidity for your own created token! Other people can now start to trade your personalized token! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
